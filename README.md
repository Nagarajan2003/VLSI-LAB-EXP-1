# VLSI-LAB-EXPERIMENTS
AIM: To simulate and synthesis Logic Gates,Adders and Subtractor using Xilinx ISE.

APPARATUS REQUIRED: Xilinx 14.7 Spartan6 FPGA

PROCEDURE: STEP:1 Start the Xilinx navigator, Select and Name the New project. STEP:2 Select the device family, device, package and speed. STEP:3 Select new source in the New Project and select Verilog Module as the Source type. STEP:4 Type the File Name and Click Next and then finish button. Type the code and save it. STEP:5 Select the Behavioral Simulation in the Source Window and click the check syntax. STEP:6 Click the simulation to simulate the program and give the inputs and verify the outputs as per the truth table. STEP:7 Select the Implementation in the Sources Window and select the required file in the Processes Window. STEP:8 Select Check Syntax from the Synthesize XST Process. Double Click in the Floorplan Area/IO/Logic-Post Synthesis process in the User Constraints process group. UCF(User constraint File) is obtained. STEP:9 In the Design Object List Window, enter the pin location for each pin in the Loc column Select save from the File menu. STEP:10 Double click on the Implement Design and double click on the Generate Programming File to create a bitstream of the design.(.v) file is converted into .bit file here. STEP:12 Load the Bit file into the SPARTAN 6 FPGA STEP:11 On the board, by giving required input, the LEDs starts to glow light, indicating the output.

VERILOG CODE:
```
full adder(code):
module fulladder(sum,cout, a,b,c);
input a,b,c;
output sum,cout;
  wire w1,w2,w3,w4,w5;
  xor x1(w1,a,b);
  xor x2(sum,w1,c);  
  and a1(w2,a,b);
  and a2(w3,b,c);
  and a3(w4,a,c);
  
  or o1(w5,w2,w3);
  or o2(cout,w5,w4);
    
endmodule
```
OUTPUT:
